# Yoga-Pose-Estimation-and-Feedback Mechanism Through Self-Learning

### Objective: Design a Machine Learning based application that monitors the yoga pose performed by the practitioner and gives real time feedback for improvement of  the yoga posture.
◦ Develop a machine learning model to assess five yoga poses perform by the practitioner Downdog,
Warrior-2, Plank, Tree, Goddess and suggest feedback to the practitioner to correct their pose.
◦ Performed suitable data cleaning & consolidation of image dataset and applied suitable image
pre-processing techniques such as image resizing, sharpening, brightness & contrast adjustment.
◦ Used Google’s Mediapipe library to segment body from background and obtained 33 different 3D
body coordinates.
◦ Calculated 12 different body angles using cosine formula as features for the pose and trained the
data using different classifiers such as KNN, Random Forest, SVC, Decision Trees.
◦ When the person performs a pose, a snapshot is taken and the accuracy scores & feedback is displayed to
the practitioner for self correction.
